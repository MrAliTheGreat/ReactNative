Using npm init will give us a package.json file. Then we can install different modules using npm install as before.
For creating a server on localhost we can use json-server module.
First, we have create a db.json file which will hold our data. It's the db!
Then we have run the server! For that we have to define a script that can be run using "npm run".
The script can be seen in package.json script under db! ("json-server --watch db.json")
When "npm run db" is executed in terminal this will start a server on localhost port 3000.
If the port is in use we can use -p to specify a port number!

ngrok is a cool tool to be honest! It will forward our server to another server that can be access from anywhere!
Like it will forward localhost to some other server that has a specific URL and can be accessed from any place!
This forwarding will happen for 8 hours and whenever we restart another 8 hours will be placed! Just the URL for the remote server will change!
For running this tunnel we can use "ngrok http 3000" script in the script section of package.json and run "npm run tunnel" in the terminal.
I wanted to do localhost so I didn't try this out!
Important: "json-server --watch db.json" will run the server on localhost(127.0.0.1:3000)
           If we want to run server on our local IP then we have to find the pc's ip via ipconfig and then add host param to the command as below:
           "json-server --host 192.168.1.1 --watch db.json" --> WiFi
           "json-server --host 172.20.10.1 --watch db.json" --> LAN
